<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div></div><div>The amniotic cerebellum is located
at the anterior portion of the hindbrain and contains the majority of mature
neurons in the central nervous system. It serves to integrate various sensory
input to generate precise motor control<sup>1</sup> and also plays a role in
higher cognitive functions through its extensive associations with cerebral
networks<sup>2</sup>.</div><div></div><div>Despite its scale, the cerebellum is
compositionally simple. It contains a monolayer of GABAergic Purkinje cells
with their dendritic arbors extruding ventrally where they interface with
glutamatergic granule cell exons. A layer of glutamatergic granule cells lies
beneath the Purkinje cells, which themselves border the white matter. The white
matter contains the cerebellar nuclei that interact with the Purkinje cells and
serve as the gateway for cerebellar output.</div><div></div><div>The cerebellar anlage occupies the dorsal
rhombomere 1 in the rostral hindbrain and is bookended by <i>Otx2</i>-expression in the midbrain (Millet et al. 1996) and <i>Hoxa2</i> expression at the r1/r2 boundary (Wingate
and Hatte, 1999). FGF8 signalling at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary in early
mouse development is also important for defining the cerebellar anlage (maybe: Suzuki-Hirano
et al., 2010). With the cerebellar anlage
in place, the precursors of the two dominant cell types emerge. The
glutamatergic precursor granule cells derive from the rostral rhombic lip
<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{8816703}</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wingate_2001}</cite> between E? and E? and are characterized by the expression of <i>Atoh1 </i>. &nbsp;Atoh1 expression is maintained throughout
transit amplification, which is the migration of granule cell precursors
from the rhombic lip towards the MHB along the dorsal surface of the hindbrain to create the external germinal layer <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{10498676}</cite>. Expression of this gene is required
to prevent differentiation into mature granule cells and maintains the Atoh1-expressiing
cells in a proliferative state during transit (ref). Following transit, (what
about proliferation at the destination??) <i>Atoh1</i> is downregulated and <i>Neurod1 </i>is upregulated&nbsp; to initiate differentiation of the GPCdifferentiate into mature GCs while
migrating radially towards the ventricular zone (ref?). En route, the maturing
GCs pass the GABAergic Purkinje cells. The Purkinje cells derive from the ventricular zone and are characterized by the expression of <i>Ptf1a <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hoshino_2005}</cite></i></div><div></div><div>The format of this template follows the typical journal publication which includes an <b>abstract</b> for summarizing the article, an <b>introduction</b>, <b>results</b> and <b>conclusion</b>.
