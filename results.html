Two hundred and fifty cells were randomly selected from each sample (-- cells in total). For each gene, the mean pairwise Manhattan distance between all n cells expressing the gene was compared to a null distribution of mean pairwise distances generated by monte carlo simulation. Distances were calculated in a reduced 20-dimensional space using the first 20 principal components of the dataset after removal of genes present in fewer than 5 cells. Randomly expressed genes (p &gt; 0.001) were removed from consideration. PCA and pairwise distance matrices were repeatedly updated after removal of every 500 randomly-expressed genes, with p-values and mean pairwise distances recomputed for all remaining genes at each iteration &nbsp;An enrichment score for each non-randomly expressed gene was determined as the ratio of the mean simulated vs calculated pairwise distance.</div><div></div><div>Ranking genes by their enrichment scores shows many of th</div><div></div>
